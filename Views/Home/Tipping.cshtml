MyVpubWallet allows you to tip other people VP directly on Twitter, Reddit, Discord@*, Telegram, YouTube, Facebook*@ or via Email.
<br /><br />
Tip anyone directly from your <a href="/">unlocked wallet</a>: Instead of sending directly to an Vpub address select one of the other options and send out your Vpub, we will notify the receiver for you. Or simply write your tip (<b>Vpub, mVP, $, Usd, Euro</b> or even <b>Cookies</b> or <b>Beers</b>) in any of the supported platforms where we have bots running and listening:<br /><br />
<ul>
	<li><b><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/vpub">Twitter</a></b>: Mention <a href="https://twitter.com/MyVpubWallet">@@MyVpubWallet</a> in your tweet reply and the amount you want to tip, for example: <pre>@@MyVpubWallet thanks, here is 0.1mVPUB</pre>
	Or write a new tweet to the person you want to tip and also mention @@MyVpubWallet in there like ("a beer" will tip the equivalent Vpub amount of $1.00, "cookie" is $0.50, etc.):<pre>@@TheDesertLynx Superb article, have a beer on me @@MyVpubWallet</pre></li>
	<li><b><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vpubpay/">Reddit</a></b>: <a href="https://reddit.com/u/MyVpubWallet">/u/MyVpubWallet</a> is listening to all sub reddits and will allow you to tip or check your balance, deposit, withdrawal, etc. (<a href="https://reddit.com/u/MyVpubWallet">all commands explained here</a>), for example reply to a post you like with: <pre>/u/MyVpubWallet Great website, here is 1 mVP</pre></li>
	<li><b><a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/9z8zX5j">Discord</a></b>: Check if the MyVpubWallet bot is running on your server (e.g. <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/9z8zX5j">Vpub on Discord</a>), if not ask the admins to add the bot: <a href="https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=423162737372299265&permissions=18432&scope=bot">@@MyVpubWallet#4428 (click to autorize if you are a server admin)</a>. You can issues commands to the bot like: !price, !help, !balance, !deposit, !withdrawal, !account or !tip, for example: <pre>!tip @@TheDesertLynx $1.50 great article</pre></li>
	@*<li><b><a href="https://t.me/VpubDigitalCash">Telegram</a></b>: Check if the MyVpubWallet bot is running in your channel (e.g. <a href="https://t.me/VpubDigitalCash">VpubDigitalCash</a>) and issue commands like /tip, /price or /balance, for example: <pre>/tip @@MarkMason $0.1 thanks for getting rid of the spam</pre></li>*@
	<li><b>Other</b>: We don't have bots running on other social platforms yet, but you can still easily tip anyone via email (select the email option when sending from your unlocked wallet). You can also tip yourself via email and then give the link to anyone (same goes for private messages you receive on reddit, discord or twitter), but be aware ANYONE that has this link can access all the funds on that address, don't post it publicly.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Can I tip without having any Vpub in MyVpubWallet yet?</h3>
Yes, unlike most other tipping services we do not require you to deposit Vpub (via the /deposit command). If you have a balance (from previous tips or deposits by you) it will be used for tipping, if your tip exceeds your balance the bot will notify you to send Vpub directly to the receiver via a link. Note 2018-03-22: This feature is currently under development and only available on the beta site until testing is done.
<br /><br />
This means you can use MyVpubWallet tipping completely <b>trustless</b>, never having any Vpub outside of your control, but in order to do that you have to confirm every single tip yourself (either with your hardware wallet or your keystore wallet). MyVpubWallet makes this easy with simple link, unlock, send, confirm, done workflow, but we are aware that for users that tip often this isn't as nice as sitting on the couch and randomly tipping people while reading posts, articles or checking out videos.
<br /><br />
For that reason MyVpubWallet supports a <b>tipping pot</b> as well (check via the /balance command). Anything you receive via tips or any Vpub you send to your address given via the /deposit command will end up in your tipping pot for future use. If you have redirected your receive address (via /account) to an address only you control MyVpubWallet will still send all received tips to that address, but it cannot send any Vpub and will create a new address next time you call /tip, /account or /deposit.
<br /><br />
<h3>What happens if the receipent doesn't use MyVpubWallet yet?</h3>
It doesn't matter, MyVpubWallet simply sends Vpub from your address to any other address, like any other Vpub wallet also does. However if you tip someone in one of the social platforms or via email, the receipent automatically gets a new account he can log into with one click to claim his Vpub, send it anywhere else, keep it or tip it to someone else.
<br /><br />
<h3>I made a mistake, can I get my tip back?</h3>
If you made a mistake while tipping (invalid vpub address, invalid email, unknown user, etc.) MyVpubWallet will immediately inform you and cancel the tip right away. However if you send someone Vpub and the transaction is on the blockchain, it is irreversable and cannot be claimed back. We are aware that tipping someone via Reddit, Twitter, etc. or via Email doesn't mean the receiver will actually claim his newly received Vpub. For this reason there is a time-out if the receiver DOES NOT have a MyVpubWallet yet: After 7 days newly created tip accounts will be destroyed again and all funds will be send back to the original sender. No time-outs for existing users, once you receive Vpub and see it in your balance, it is yours, we will never take it back. To feel safe we recommend moving any received Vpub to an address only you control (either on a hardware wallet or via your own keystore, then only you control the funds via your private keys). You can also tell the MyVpubWallet bot to use a specific Vpub address for receiving (via the /account command), in this case the funds are always under your control, we can't refund or help with any issues in this case.
